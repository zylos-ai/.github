Claude Code is a genius — but it wakes up with amnesia every session. No memory of yesterday, no way to reach you, no ability to act on its own.

Zylos gives it a life. Memory that survives restarts. A scheduler that works while you sleep. Communication through Telegram, Lark, or a web console. Self-maintenance that keeps everything running. And because Claude Code can program, it can evolve — building new skills, integrating new services, growing alongside you.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (will be published to npm soon)
npm install -g --install-links https://github.com/zylos-ai/zylos-core

# Initialize
zylos init
```

Zylos will guide you through setting up your agent, including Claude Code authentication and component installation.
